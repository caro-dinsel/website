```
bundle exec jekyll serve
``` 

To build the theme.
 
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```
### Github Pages
When using Github Pages you will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` otherwise all the css, images and paths will be broken.

For example the site https://zerostaticthemes.github.io/jekyll-serif-theme would have `baseurl: "/jekyll-serif-theme/"`
